## PROJECT NAME: 

Netflix Data Analysis Using Tableau 


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

    ‚Ä¢	Advance Excel

    ‚Ä¢	MySQL | SQL Server

    ‚Ä¢	Tableau

    ‚Ä¢	Statistics
    
## STEPS:

    i) Data subset collected from online.
    ii) Loading Libraries
    iii) Data Cleaning & Finding Missing values
    iv) Data Visualization
    
## DATA VISUALIZATION: 


    1) Select options for Type: Movies & Tv Shows
    
    2) Vertical Bar Graph of Rating of Shows & Movies
    
    3) Horizontal Bar Graph of Relation Between Top 10 Gerne and Movie & TV Shows count
    
    4) Pie-chart for the Type: Movie and TV Shows
    
    5) line Area Graph of Total Movies and TV shows by Year

    7) Showing Wordcloud For Country, Directors,Category, Gerne, Rating
    

## METHODOLOGY:


The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. I create a minimum of two histogram, two pie chart and one bar graph with matplotlib, seaborn and worldcloud.

### Vertical Bar Graph of Rating & Horizontal Bar Graph of Top 10 Gerne.
